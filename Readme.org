#+Title:mutuals 2 list

This python script lets you create a list of all your mutuals (people you follow and follow you back) so that you can more easily find their toots and not miss any.

* How to use

1. Clone the repository
   #+begin_src shell
     git clone https://github.com/internet-memme/mutuals2list
     cd mutuals2list
   #+end_src
  
2. Install the dependencies found in [[file:req.txt][req.txt]]. This can be done with pip. You might want to setup a virtual environment first.
#+begin_src shell
  python3 -m venv .
  source bin/activate
  pip install -r req.txt
#+end_src

3. Setup environment variables. The script reads your account details from environment variables. You need to set these accordingly:
   #+begin_example
   MASTODON_API_URL
   USERNAME
   PASSWORD
   #+end_example
4. Run the script
   #+begin_src shell
     ./mutuals2list.py
   #+end_src
